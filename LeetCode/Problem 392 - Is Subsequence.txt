Problem 392 - Is Subsequence
	https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/

	Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

	A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) 
	of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. 
	(ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
