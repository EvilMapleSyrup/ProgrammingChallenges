Problem 703 - Kth Largest Element in a Stream
	https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/

	Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

	Implement KthLargest class:

		-KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.
		-int add(int val) Returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.

Solution - Python

	import heapq as hq
	class KthLargest:

    	def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
	        self.heap = []
    	    self.k = k
        
        	for num in nums:
            	self.add(num)

	    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
    	    hq.heappush(self.heap, val)
        	
	        if len(self.heap) > self.k:
    	        heapq.heappop(self.heap)
            
	        return self.heap[0]

	# Your KthLargest object will be instantiated and called as such:
	# obj = KthLargest(k, nums)
	# param_1 = obj.add(val)
