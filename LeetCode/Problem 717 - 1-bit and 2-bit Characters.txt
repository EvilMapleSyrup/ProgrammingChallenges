Problem 717 - 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
	https://leetcode.com/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters/

	We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

	Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

	class Solution:
	    def isOneBitCharacter(self, bits: List[int]) -> bool:
    	    length, i = len(bits)-1, 0
        	while i < length:
	            i += 1 + bits[i]
    	    return i == length
