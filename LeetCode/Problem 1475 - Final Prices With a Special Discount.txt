	Given the array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop. There is a special discount for items in the shop,
	if you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index
	such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i], otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.
